I"¾<p>I was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone but have resided in the United States since 1997. I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Central Florida and was subsequently employed as a Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton.
I later pursued a Masterâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida focusing on Thermal Sciences and Fluid Dynamics. After completing the M.S. degree, I was awarded a Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship via which I interned at the National Energy Technology Laboratory. 
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at UF, investigating the performance of complex metal oxides in solar thermochemical energy storage and conversion.</p>
