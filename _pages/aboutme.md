I was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone but have resided in the United States since 1997. I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Central Florida and was subsequently employed as a Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton.
I later pursued a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida focusing on Thermal Sciences and Fluid Dynamics. After completing the M.S. degree, I was awarded a Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship via which I interned at the National Energy Technology Laboratory. 
Ph.D. graduate in Mechanical Engineering from UF, investigated entropic properties of complex nonstoichiometric oxides for solar thermochemical energy storage and conversion. 
Currently building Technical Consulting Practice in solar thermal energy technology, open to opportunities in renewables/solar energy technology R&D and business development, data science, and quantitative finance.
